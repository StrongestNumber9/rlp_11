All configuration files are expected to be in `/opt/teragrep/rlp_11/etc` directory and readable by user `srv-rlp_11`.

The simple `rlp_11` service will use `rlp_11.properties` and `log4j2.xml` files that are provided in the rpm.

Multi-instance `rlp_11@InstaceNameReplaceMe` service will use `rlp_11.InstaceNameReplaceMe.properties` and `log4j2.InstaceNameReplaceMe.xml` files that must be provided by the user.

=== Zabbix

Import the template, add `{$PROMETHEUS_HOST}` macro with full url to the metrics endpoint to wanted host and link it to `rlp_11_prometheus` template.
